# Kaggle kernel votes analysis
Analysis to gain votes for a kernel on Kaggle using Meta Kaggle dataset.
The analysis is also available as __[Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/aleksandradeis/how-to-get-upvotes-for-a-kernel-on-kaggle)__.

## Introduction
I have recently joined Kaggle and started to create public kernels. My kernels have a lot of views, but no upvotes. So I decided to analyze __[Meta Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle)__ to find out:
* Statistics for kernels, which have votes.
* How different factors affect the number of votes (for example, characteristics of the author, source dataset etc.)?
* And finally, make the recommendations on how to make the kernel useful, so other kagglers would cast upvotes.

## Key Findings
Findings and recommendations from this analysis:

1. __It is hard to create a really helpful kernel, which will be appreciated and upvoted by Kagglers__: only 20% of kernels have upvotes and only 4% of kernels have awards (have more than 5 upvotes).
2. __Views and comments bring upvotes__: consider adding a captivating title to the kernel and sharing the link to the kernel with others, the more people will view the kernel - the more people will find it useful.
3. __Active authors have more votes__: try to be an active author and gain visibility, experience in writing kernels and feedback from the others will eventually help to get votes.
4. __It doesn't really matter what topic the kernel is related to, but it matters how the kernel material is presented__: notebooks tend to be more appreciated by Kagglers.
